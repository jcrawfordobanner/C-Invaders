### C-Invaders

By: Diego Berny and Jordan Crawford-O'Banner

# Project Goals
The goal of our project is to recreate the classic arcade game Space Invaders using the C skills we have learned thus far. The lower bound for our project is to learn enough about graphics programming to create a group of enemies that will move across the screen in a predictable pattern and occasionally shoot blasts. Our reach goal would be to implement a full level of Space Invaders that includes destroyable enemies, a playable character that can be interfaced with from the keyboard, and a point system.

# Learning Goals
For this project we would like to learn a lot more about the processes behind creating graphics in c. We would also like to learn more about c programs that directly interact with  a user through some form of interface.

# Resources
We need to obtain more information about the different visualization software options that can interact well with c. We are searching for tutorials using those software especially in the context of game design. The final resource we are looking for  information how to use keyboard input in c programs that does not come through the command line.

# First Steps
The first step in this project is to identify the best visualization software to use. Jordan will be in charge of identifying a software and finding a tutorial that will help both members effectively use it. Diego Berny is responsible for search for ways to interact with programs using the keyboard as an input. Both of these tasks will be considered done with both members have completed some form of tutorial on their topic. The final task is to break the project down into more viable subtasks which is a responsibility of both students. This will be completed when the trello board has at least 5 tasks assigned in it to either team member.
